            Checked Exceptions ( unwanted )
        Exception Handling
            1. try & catch blocks
Agenda:
    Morning: Java
    Afternoon: Selenium
package name: day57_Exceptions
    
Exceptions: unwanted or unexpected events
        Exception is class that will be thrown when those unexpected and unwanted events occured
    there are two types of exceptions:
        unchecked exception (unexpected ): exceptions that occure during runtime
                    Ex: int[] arr= {1, 2, 3}
                            syso(arr[20]);
            Selenium Ex: nullpointer exception
                         No such Element Exception
                         WebDriverException 
                         WedDriver driver = new FireFoxDriver();
                                driver.get("URL")
            RunTimeException class is the parent class of all the unchked exception
            all the RuntimeExceptions are unchcked exception
        checked exception (unwanted): occures during the compile time
                those exceptions needs to be handled IMMEDIETLTY, because it will give compile error
                Ex:
                        Thread.sleep();
            All the exceptions that are not runtimeexception are called checked exception
Exception Handling:
    1. try & catch: used for handling the exception
                try{
                    exception statements/code
                } catch(ExceptionClass name){
                    statements
                }
        only one of those blocks gets executed
        try block: only gets executed if the exception is checked exception
        catch block: only gets executed if the exception is unchecked (Runtime Exception)
        Actions act = new Actions(driver);
            act.pause(3000).perform();
